## Force Convert All Table Column Values to Text in Power Apps

In scenarios where the built-in functions for changing column data types to text yield errors—often due to numeric values—this code provides a reliable workaround. This method leverages the `Text.From` function, specifying the locale "en-US" to ensure numbers are formatted correctly for the United States. If you are handling data formatted according to other locales, adjust the locale parameter accordingly.

This approach assumes the need to convert all columns in the table, making it particularly useful in comprehensive data type standardization tasks across a table.

### Code Implementation
```
Table.TransformColumns(
    Source, 
    List.Transform(
        Table.ColumnNames(Source), 
        each {_, Text.From(_, "en-US")}
    )
)
```

### Code Explanation
1.  **`Table.TransformColumns` Function:**
    
    -   This function is used to transform the columns of a table. It takes two arguments: the source table and a list of transformations to apply.
2.  **`Source`:**
    
    -   This is the table that you are transforming. It should be replaced with the actual name of your source table variable if it's different.
3.  **`List.Transform` Function:**
    
    -   Converts each item in the list (in this case, column names of `Source`) using the given function. Here, it's used to apply the `Text.From` transformation to each column name.
4.  **`Table.ColumnNames(Source)`:**
    
    -   Generates a list of all column names in the `Source` table which is then passed to `List.Transform`.
5.  **`each {_, Text.From(_, "en-US")}`:**
    
    -   An anonymous function used by `List.Transform` that takes each column name (_) and applies `Text.From` to convert each value in that column to text format. The `"en-US"` argument specifies the locale to use for formatting.
6.  **Locale Adjustment:**
    
    -   The `"en-US"` parameter in `Text.From` function is set to format numbers according to the English (United States) locale. Adjust this parameter to match the locale of your data, if necessary.

### Usage Tips

-   **Locale Considerations:** Always set the locale correctly to avoid misinterpretations of data, especially if the data includes date, time, or numbers.
-   **Check Results:** After applying this transformation, verify a few records to confirm that all data types have been correctly converted to text and are appearing as expected.
-   **Performance:** While this method is effective for ensuring data type consistency, be mindful of its impact on performance when dealing with very large tables.

This script is particularly useful in Power Apps for ensuring that data processing errors are minimized when dealing with various data types that are initially not in text format.
