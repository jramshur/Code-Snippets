// Assuming the column you want to transform is named Column1, and you want to remove the characters a, b, and c, here's the full M code expression:

let
    Source = ... , // Your data source here
    TransformedTable = Table.TransformColumns(Source, {
        {"Column1", each Text.Remove(_, {"a", "b", "c"}), type text}
    })
in
    TransformedTable

Detailed Breakdown
  Source: This is your original table. Replace the ... with your actual data source.
  Table.TransformColumns: This function is used to apply transformations to specified columns.
  First Parameter: The source table on which transformations are applied.
  Second Parameter: A list of lists, where each inner list specifies:
  Column Name: The name of the column to transform, e.g., "Column1".
  Transformation Function: A function to apply to each element of the column. Here, each Text.Remove(_, {"a", "b", "c"}) uses an anonymous function (each) where _ represents each value in the column. Text.Remove is then applied to each value to remove the characters a, b, and c.
  Type: The expected type of the output for that column, type text ensures that the output is treated as text.

Example Usage
  This approach is ideal when you want to clean text data within a column by removing unwanted characters across an entire table efficiently. This method can easily be adapted for other text transformations by replacing Text.Remove with other text functions like Text.Replace or combining it with functions like Text.ToLower if needed.

  Using Table.TransformColumns is particularly effective for applying consistent transformations across multiple columns or when integrating multiple data cleaning steps into a single, streamlined Power Query transformation.
